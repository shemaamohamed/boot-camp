# E-commerce Product List Page

This project is a simple e-commerce product listing page built using **React** and deployed on [Vercel](https://boot-camp-sooty.vercel.app/).

## Approach

The project was developed using **React** with a focus on clean code and component-based architecture. The main objective was to create a responsive and user-friendly product listing page.

Key features include:
- **Responsive design**: The page adjusts seamlessly to different screen sizes by `CSS & React Bootstrap`.
- **Component reusability**: React components were designed to be reusable and modular.
- **State management**: Managed locally using React hooks like `useState` and `useEffect` for updating data.

## Running the Application Locally

To run the application locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/shemaamohamed/boot-camp.git

   ```

3. Install the necessary dependencies:
   ```bash

   ```

4. Start the development server:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

   The app will run on [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000), and changes you make will auto-refresh the page.
